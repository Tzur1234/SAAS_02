## Introduction

In this project, I have developed a robust Facial Recognition application that offers a range of functionalities.
The application allows users to effortlessly sign up, securely provide credit details, and begin utilizing its unique API key.

By leveraging this API key, users can conveniently send REST API requests, including images, and receive comprehensive Image analysis results, including the number of recognized images.

This project serves as a testament to the utilization of various cutting-edge technologies. It provides a glimpse into the intricacies of managing large-scale systems, aligning with contemporary industry standards. By working on this project, I have gained valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of modern software development.

This is a project that makes use of many diverse technologies. It gives a small taste of how large systems are managed according to the industry standards nowadays.


## Project structre
At a high level, the system's architecture relies on API requests for communication between the frontend and backend. Views handle each request, responding with JSON data in the Response object.

The backend uses Django Rest Framework, a powerful toolkit for Web APIs. The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript for efficient processing.

Two key external APIs are integrated: Stripe API for customer management, subscriptions, and payments, and SendinBlue API for email communication. These APIs enhance functionality and user experience.

By combining Django, Django Rest Framework, JavaScript, and the Stripe and SendinBlue APIs, this project demonstrates a well-rounded architecture using industry-standard technologies.


## What I have learned
Throughout this project, I acquired valuable knowledge and skills in optimizing the communication infrastructure by leveraging the Django Rest Framework in the backend and JavaScript in the frontend. This approach significantly reduced the load on the system while ensuring efficient and secure data transfer. Additionally, I gained expertise in harnessing the power of APIs to expedite development time and deliver a high-quality and secure service.

## Amazon S3:
During this project, I had the opportunity to work with Amazon S3 for the first time. Amazon S3 serves as a reliable storage solution for both static and media files. It provides seamless access and efficient management of data through an S3 compliant interface. In this specific project, I utilized the DigitalOcean Space interface, which enabled me to leverage the capabilities of Amazon S3 and effectively handle storage requirements for static and media files. This experience expanded my understanding of cloud-based storage solutions and their integration into real-world applications.
